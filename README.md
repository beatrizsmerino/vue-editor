# Vue editor

![Vue editor](./README/images/vue-editor.jpg)

## Description

✨&nbsp; This repo was created to demonstrate that `vue-json-editor` and `svg-symbol-sprite-loader` packages can coexist together.

🐛 &nbsp; Since when I used both packages in a project some incompatibility errors occurred and the default json editor icons were not displayed.

Maybe someone will find it helpful too 😁

## NPM packages

- The [`vue-json-editor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-json-editor) package is a vue component that can be used to create a json editor.

- The [`svg-symbol-sprite-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-symbol-sprite-loader) package is a webpack loader and plugin for creating SVG sprites.
